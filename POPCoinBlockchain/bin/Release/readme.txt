This program retrieves a zip archive of the POPCoin blockchain from an online server and expands it into a user-definable folder.

The download URL is specified in the config file.

After installation of the blockchain files, this program may be safely removed.  Alternatively, it may be retained and used to download future updated blockchain zip files.

Made by the guy known as Krank, you can find me on discord.  POPCoin tips gratefully accepted at QcjY9d25iGjkymRmvuBaV5xFqc3mUrKNdG.
